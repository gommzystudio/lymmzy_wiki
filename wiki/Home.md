## Getting started
You can enter Lymmzy.com with Minecraft Java 1.17. To be able to play you need an original Minecraft Java Account from [Minecraft.net](https://minecraft.net).

## First time join

When you play on lymmzy for the first time, the server will try to install a resource pack. You have to accept it with "Yes" otherwise you will get kicked and you won't be able to play on our server

Once you've downloaded the texturepack, you're ready to begin your adventure on lymmzy. At a first step you have to do two tutorial quests. You can see your current quest by running "/menu" and then click on the "Quests" icon.
