## Overview
Quests are a fundermental part of Lymmzy. With the command /menu, you can open a menu where you can view your current quest. Based on your quest progress, your level is also measured. This can be a maximum of 100. The quest progress of all players is reset to 25 every month for those who were at least level 25 before. With the quests you can get coins, as well as claimblocks.
