## Overview
Clans are a way of identifying a group of players. What the purpose of a clan is is up to the players alone. You can simply build together or wage war against other clans. Furthermore, there is a clan fund where each clan member can donate 5000 coins per day. With the donated money, the clan can be updated so that it can accept more members and gets a different color in the tablist.

If you want to manage the individual members of your clan, you can click on them in the clan GUI and promote them to moderator or demote them to member. It is also possible for the leader and moderators to kick players out of the clan. Moreover, only they can invite new people to the clan.
