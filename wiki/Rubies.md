## Overview
Rubies are a type of premium currency on Lymmzy. Except for the rubies you can buy in the store, every player can get the same amount of rubies. These cannot be exchanged among each other. Rubies can be used to buy boxes at the spawn, for example.

## How to obtain Rubies
There are three different ways to get Rubies. The first is the daily vote on the server lists for Lymmzy.com. Another way is to get 20 rubies for free in the store once a week. The last option is to buy them in the store for real money.
