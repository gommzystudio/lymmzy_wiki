Dungeons
Playing dungeons is an important part of the server.
Through dungeons you get very good loot like diamonds and other resources, as well as custom items like Mana, Claimland, Bloodarmor, Titanarmor, Ivoryaxes and Titanpickaxes as weapons like IronBlades, Hammer of gravity, Glaive and Hearthstealer. As well as custom enchantments. You enter dungeons at spawn. You can also play a dungeon with your friends, when you go in you have one minute to gather with your friends, a code is displayed at your actionbar and you have to give it to your friends who can join with (/join [code] ). The loot is determined individually. The rooms are opened by destroying the soul sand. In some rooms there are chests from which you get your loot. In one of the rooms there is a boss room where you have to kill the Evoker and then leave the dungeon via the iron door.
