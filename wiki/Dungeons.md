## Overview
Playing dungeons is an important part of the server.
Through dungeons you get very good loot like diamonds and other resources, as well as custom items like Mana, Claimland, Bloodarmor, Titanarmor, Ivoryaxes and Titanpickaxes as weapons like IronBlades, Hammer of gravity, Glaive and Hearthstealer. As well as custom enchantments. You enter dungeons at spawn.

## Join a Dungeon
When you join a dungeon, you will find a zombie at the spawn. When you click on it, you can play the dungeon level you have selected. You unlock dungeon levels by completing the level before it.

The loot is determined individually. The rooms are opened by destroying the soul sand. In some rooms there are chests from which you get your loot.
