## What are Claims
Claims are a way to keep your structures and items safe from other players. Claims correspond to chunks and you can claim any chunk as long as it has not been claimed by another player. On our livemap you can find all chunks, which are already claimed and which are still free. Claimed chunks are highlighted in color.

## How to Claim
If you have decided to claim a property, you first need a certain number of claimblocks. This is the number of blocks you can claim. You can claim a chunk with 256 blocks. You can get claimblocks in chests, dungeons, as well as by trading with other players.

Once you have chosen a free chunk, you can use the /claim command to manage your claims. There you can click on one of the free claim slots to create your claim.

## How to manage a Claim
If you want to manage your claim, stand on the claim and type /claim again. There you can add/remove other players from your claim, expand the property or delete it.
